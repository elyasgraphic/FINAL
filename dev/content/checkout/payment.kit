            The Glowforge Air Filter uses activated carbon and HEPA filters to clean the air that comes out of your
            Glowforge printer. It sits on the floor near your printer and comes with handles and wheels so itâ€™s easy to
            move. It has an on/off switch and a dial to adjust the fan power for maximum filter life.
